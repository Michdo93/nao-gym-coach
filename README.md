# nao-gym-coach
The Nao robot acts as a trainer/workout partner for a little full-body workout.

## Description

The Behaviour is structured in such a way that three different parts of the programme can be executed. These are Welcome, Tai Chi and Workout. The workout involves stretching as well as lunges, classic squats, trapped squats or isometric chest presses.

Here is an assignment of bumpers to the sub-programmes:

* Left bumper pressed = greeting
* Right bumper pressed = Tai Chi
* Both bumpers pressed = Workout
